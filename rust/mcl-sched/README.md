# mcl_sched
This crate provides an installable wrapper for the MCL (Minos Compute Library) Scheduler 'mcl_sched'

## Summary
This is a convenience crate for building and installing the MCL (Minos Compute Library) Scheduler 'mcl_sched'.
This can be installed using
```
cargo install mcl_sched
```
The installed mcl_sched binary can be used with both C and Rust based MCL applications (although C applications will have likely already built the scheduler manually).
Once installed, the scheduler usage is the same as if you built it manually from source.

This wrapper will try to use the system default OpenCL implementation.
If not found you will be prompted to set the ```OCL_PATH_INC``` and ```OCL_PATH_LIB``` environment variables to point the appropriate OpenCL headers and libraries.
For complex installations we recommend building MCL manually.
Instructions for this can be found at [MCL](https://github.com/pnnl/mcl).



## Installing mcl_sched
### Required libraries/ crates
* [libmcl-sys](https://github.com/pnnl/mcl/tree/master/rust/libmcl-sys) and its dependencies
* Other crates listed in Cargo.toml


### Instructions
mcl_sched depends on the crate libmcl-sys which provides the low-level rust bindings for the C library of MCL 

```libmcl-sys``` makes use of clang to generate the low-level rust binding from the ```MCL``` header file, so if clang is not available it must be installed to the system.

1. Install clang

Once all dependencies have been taken care of, we can install mcl_sched.

2. ```bash
cargo install mcl_sched
```

## Running
mcl_sched comes with a set of unit tests that can be executed with:
```
mcl_sched
``` 



## STATUS
MCL, libmcl-sys, and mcl_sched are research prototypes and still under development, thus not all intended features are yet implemented.

## CONTACTS
