# libmcl-sys
This system crate provides Rust language bindings (via the use of Bindgen) for [Minos Computing Library](https://github.com/pnnl/mcl) (MCL).
It is highly recommended that instead of using libmcl-sys directly your instead use the higer level (and safer) [mcl-rs](https://crates.io/crates/mcl-rs) crate

## Build requirements
- Rust
- Cargo
- Clang
- OpenCL
- Autotools
- MCL (either manually installed or via ```cargo install mcl_sched```)

## How to build (Tested on Linux) without previous build of MCL
0. Set the ```OCL_PATH_INC``` and ```OCL_PATH_LIB``` environmental variables with the path to OpenCL ```include``` and ```lib``` (or ```lib64```) directories respectively. 
    Note: this may not be needed if OpenCL is in the system directories
    
1. install mcl_sched: 
    ```bash
    cargo install mcl_sched
    ```

2. Build using Cargo
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

## How to build (Tested on Linux) with manually built MCL
1.  set the ```MCL_PATH``` environmental variable with the path to MCL installation directory. For example in bash use:

    ```bash
    export MCL_PATH=/path/to/mcl/install/
    ```
    Cargo will try to find the ```lib/``` and ```include/``` directories based on that.

2. Set the ```OCL_PATH_INC``` and ```OCL_PATH_LIB``` environmental variables with the path to OpenCL ```include``` and ```lib``` (or ```lib64```) directories respectively. 

    Note: this may not be needed if OpenCL is in the system directories

3. Build using Cargo

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
    This should produce an ```.rlib``` file in ```target/release/``` directory.

## How to test
libmcl-sys comes with a set of unit tests that can be executed by running:

```bash
 cargo test --release
```
**Reminder**: The MCL scheduler should be running when executing the tests.
if you installed mcl_sched via cargo then you should be able to invoke directly:
```bash
 mcl_sched
```
If you built mcl manually you may need to specify the path to the mcl_sched binary

## FEATURE FLAGS
We expose three feauture flags, losely corresponding to configuration options of the underlying MCL c-library
1.  mcl_debug - enables debug logging output from the underlying c-libary
2.  shared_mem - enables interprocess host shared memory buffers
3.  pocl_extensions - enables interprocess device based shared memory buffers, requires a patched version of POCL 1.8 to have been succesfully installed (please see <https://github.com/pnnl/mcl/tree/dev#using-custom-pocl-extensions> for more information)

## STATUS
MCL (and libmcl-sys) is a research prototype and still under development, thus not all intended features are yet implemented.

## CONTACTS
