# libmcl-sys
This system crate provides Rust language bindings (via the use of Bindgen) for [Minos Computing Library](https://github.com/pnnl/mcl) (MCL).

## Build requirements
- Rust
- Cargo
- Clang
- OpenCL
- MCL

## How to build (Tested on Linux)
1. Set the ```MCL_PATH``` environmental variable with the path to MCL installation directory. For example in bash use:

    ```bash
    export MCL_PATH=/path/to/mcl/install/
    ```
    Cargo will try to find the ```lib/``` and ```include/``` directories based on that.

2. Set the ```OCL_PATH_INC``` and ```OCL_PATH_LIB``` environmental variables with the path to OpenCL ```include``` and ```lib``` (or ```lib64```) directories respectively. 

    Note: this may not be needed if OpenCL is in the system directories

3. Build using Cargo

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
    This should produce an ```.rlib``` file in ```target/release/``` directory.

## How to test
libmcl-sys comes with a set of unit tests that can be executed by running:

```bash
 cargo test --release
```
**Reminder**: The MCL scheduler should be running when executing the tests.

## STATUS
MCL (and libmcl-sys) is a research prototype and still under development, thus not all intended features are yet implemented.
